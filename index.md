# This is my blog

I'm Igor Bugajski, online frequently going by the nickname GOKOP or variations.
I like programming and music and I'm studying applied computer science.
At some point I plan to post semi-frequently on this blog,
but if you're reading this sentence then I haven't started yet. (infrequent posts might appear though)

I don't believe that any recruiter is gonna read this but if you are one
then I'm interested in programming-related internships in Toru≈Ñ, Poland or remotely.
You can email me at igorbugajski@protonmail.com
