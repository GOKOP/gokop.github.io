This is my website. [LINK](https://gokop.github.io/site/)

The actual website is in the folder "site", because it's generated by [my script](https://www.github.com/GOKOP/static-blog-gen).
The reason why the entire thing is in this repo is ease of use.
If you want to have a closer look at the script then you probably want to visit its repo (linked above)
