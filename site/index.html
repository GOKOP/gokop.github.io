<p>I’m Igor Bugajski, online frequently going by the nickname GOKOP or variations. I like programming and music and I’m studying applied computer science. At some point I plan to post semi-frequently on this blog, but if you’re reading this sentence then I haven’t started yet. (infrequent posts might appear though)</p>
<p>I don’t believe that any recruiter is gonna read this but if you are one then I’m interested in programming-related interships in Toruń, Poland or remotely. You can email me at igorbugajski@protonmail.com</p>
