<h1 id="the-first-post">The first post</h1>
<p>So I’ve decided that I’m gonna start a blog.</p>
<p>Why? It would sound nice if I said that I wanted to express myself and share my learning experience or something else along these lines, but in reality it’s just that I wanted to write a <a href="https://github.com/GOKOP/static-blog-gen">shell script</a> to generate a static blog and then I just wanted to use it somehow. I also like the idea of having your own place on the internet, even if I’m not sure what to do with it, and that’s how this blog was born.</p>
<p>The kind of content that I plan to post here is programming and/or general IT related stuff about things that I’ll happen to be doing or thinking, if they’ll be interesting. I don’t plan to diverge from this subject so don’t except lifestyle advice (like I was competent to give it lol) or political essays.</p>
<p>Do I think that anyone’s gonna read this? No, but there’s no analytics of any kind here (especially that for now it’s hosted on Github Pages) so I can live in blissful ignorance. :)</p>
